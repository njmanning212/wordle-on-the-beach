Want to improve your NY Times Wordle ability and skip the ads of those other apps? **Wordle On The Beach** is your training grounds. Nearly identical to both the paper-and-pen game Jotto from 1955 and the television game Lingo, players are given six chances to guess a five-letter secret word using only other five-letter English words. The goal is to take as few guesses as possible. Feedback is given to the player with each guessed word if any of the letters match those in the secret word (background changing to orange) and if the letter is in the same place in the secret word (background changing to blue). Both button presses and key presses are supported in **Wordle On The Beach**.

# **Added Features:**
We've added a couple of features to help you develop your skills! 
* If your guess word isn't a five-letter word in English we'll let you know!

* Our streak system will help you keep track of how many secret words in a row you've revealed. No cheating and changing difficulty or resetting early!

* Our hint feature will give you a letter in the secret word if you haven't found it yet. Did it disappear with only four letters found? Watch out for words with double letters!

* Getting better? Increase the difficulty!
